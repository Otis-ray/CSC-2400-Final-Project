# CSC-2400-Final-Project
Final Project
This is a group final project for CSC2400: Design of Algorithms; our project topic is Union-Find. The collaborators on this project are: Robert Morris, Nolan Schiek, John Sutton, and Sawyer Blanchford There are 2 executable files in this repository: experiments.py and plot_results.py. Run experiments.py first to generate the CSV with results, then run plot_results.py.

This repository contains my individual submission for the CSC 2400 Union-Find Empirical Analysis project.
