# CSC-2400-Final-Project
Final Project
This is a group final project for CSC2400: Design of Algorithms; our project topic is Union-Find. The collaborators on this project are: Robert Morris, Nolan Schiek, John Sutton, and Sawyer Blanchford There are 2 executable files in this repository: experiments.py and plot_results.py. Run experiments.py first to generate the CSV with results, then run plot_results.py.

- `list_uf.py` – List-based Union-Find implementation  
- `tree_uf.py` – Tree-based Union-Find with union-by-size and path compression  
- `run_workloads.py` – Experiment driver and data generation  
- `results.csv` – Collected experimental data  
- `plots.R` – R code used to generate runtime and pointer-update graphs  
- `Final Report.pdf` – Full written analysis  
- `Presentation.pdf` – Slides for in-class presentation  

This repository contains my individual submission for the CSC 2400 Union-Find Empirical Analysis project.
